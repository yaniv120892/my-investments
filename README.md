# My Investments – Personal Investment Tracker

My Investments is a simple web app that helps you see your entire portfolio in one place. Add your holdings across categories like stocks/ETFs, cryptocurrencies, pension and education funds, money‑market funds, and foreign currencies. The app fetches live market data, converts everything to NIS, and presents a clean dashboard with allocation and performance over time.

What you can do:

- Add and edit investments and amounts you hold
- Get automatic, periodic price updates from public market data sources
- View total portfolio value in NIS and allocation by category
- Track historical snapshots to understand trends over time

Who it’s for:

- Individuals who want a clear, up‑to‑date view of their personal investments without spreadsheets

Built with Next.js and TypeScript, backed by PostgreSQL (via Prisma) and Redis for caching.

This repository contains the app’s source code only.
